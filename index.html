            <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Enoch Olivo Palayar" width="200">
            <p>Hello! My name is Enoch Olivo Palayar. I live in Bicol Philippines.</p>
            <p>I have a passion for learning on doctrine and technology, respectively. 
                I like playing basketball as a kind of keeping myself fit and balanced. 
                I'm doing a first Web and Computer Programming certificate from BYU-Idaho online university. 
                I wish to be a professional Software Developer that would enable me to be able to support the Lord in bigger ways 
                than what is possible today while at the same time continue to work towards supporting my family by utilizing the 
                skills acquired and developing impactful solutions.</p>
            <p>I served as a full-time missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
                It has been a great experience to be a missionary since the tasks entrusted to me included 
                teaching the gospel, sharing the message of Jesus Christ, service to people and community,
                and helping others gain strength for their faith and come unto Christ. 
                That experience really molded me in big ways and taught me the value of humility, 
                dedication, and spiritual growth.</p>
            <p>Even after completing my mission, I still worked in various callings in the church. 
                I am currently serving as Ward Clerk which involves working with the Bishopric of our ward closely. 
                I am also Stake Young Men Secretary; with that position, I have opportunities to work and serve alongside youth.
                In addition, I teach at the Institute. I get to teach and have meaningful gospel discussions with others, 
                which further increases their understanding of doctrine.</p>
            <p>All these experiences during my mission, and even through my continued service,
                have played a vital part in the person I have become and continue to fuel my desire to 
                improve, learn and serve others.</p>

            <p> Philippines is an archipelago comprising of over 7,000 islands with different cultures and traditions. So infused with pretty beaches, mountains and cities and with the people always depicted as warm and hospitality, Philippines hold a tight bond of family closeness comes a deep sense of community. The clashes of Eastern and Western influences in the Philippines show in its festivals, cuisines and art forms that will resonate their past. Yet despite all of this, the Filipino spirit remains strong and hopeful which makes the nation a vibrant albeit warm one.</p>
